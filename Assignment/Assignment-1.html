		<p><h3>Plot</h3></p>
		<p>In 1985 Khansaar, a puissant city-state, a tribesman, Deva, and the King Raja Mannar's son, Vardharaja "Vardha" Mannar, are inseparable companions. After Raja Mannar commands the decimation of Shouryaanga tribe, a mob pounces on Deva and his mother at their residence, but Vardha intercedes for them and confers an important territory of his in exchange for sparing their lives.
			 Before exiting Khansaar, Deva vows to return on Vardha's call.
			 In 2017, a tycoon, Krishnakanth's daughter, Aadhya, flies to Varanasi from New York, to finish her mother's last rites. This alerts her father's old rivals, who conspire to abduct her, but Krishnakanth enlists the assistance of Bilal, who thwarts the enemies' attempts to seize her and safeguards her at his friend, Deva's place in Tinsukia, Assam. There, she pretends to be an English teacher at a school where Deva's mother is the headmaster at. Eventually, she is traced to Tinsukia where upon his mother's reluctant orders, Deva hinders the goons' attempts to capture her.
			 Dreading for Deva, his mother plans to abscond with him, while Aadhya and Bilal are carried off in a convoy led by a man named Rinda and one that is sealed with the mysterious emblem of Khansaar. Witnessing this, Deva's mother signals him to rescue Aadhya and Bilal.
			 He refrains the convoy, grabbing the attention of Vardha and his step-sister, Radha Rama Mannar, who has ordered Aadhya's abduction to avenge something Krishnakanth has committed against her, in Deva's favour, seven years ago.
			 Radha admits to strategizing the events to pit Deva and Vardha against each other since opposing the seal of Khansaar is a crime and the perpetrator has to be killed, a rule that Deva himself is told to have imposed years ago. After the rescue, Bilal recounts the tale of Khansaar and all of their connections to it for Aadhya.
			 In 1127, notorious dacoits comprised three tribes: the Mannars, Shouryaangas, and Ghaniyaars. They consolidated their influence over an area called Khansaar.
			 In 1947, after the Indian independence, Raja Mannar's father, Siva Mannar, the chieftain of the Mannar tribe, refused Khansaar to be a part of the country and governed by the Constitution of India. He signed a pact with the Indian government that retained Khansaar's autonomy and erased its existence from the map.
			 He segregated Khansaar into 101 parts and appointed Kapus to head them. In the hierarchy, above the Kapus were Doras, who were feudal lords submissive to the King.
			 After Siva Mannar's demise in 1985, Dhaara, the chieftain of the Shouryaanga tribe, was democratically elected by the assembly to be the next King, but Raja Mannar usurped the throne by assassinating Dhaara and exterminated the entire Shouryaanga tribe.
			 Subsequently, he recruited his close confidants and family as Doras to superintend the city-state.
			 In 2010, Bhaarava, Raja Mannar's son-in-law, pleaded with him to consider reconciling with Vardha, who was banished in 1985 for giving away his territory to a Ghaniyaar tribesman.
			 Raja Mannar commanded Ranga (whose father Vardha bribed his territory to in 1985), one of the Doras, to sacrifice his position for Vardha's sake and thus, he was instilled with rage and jealousy towards Vardha, while Raja Mannar's children from his first wife, Rudra Raja Mannar and Radha Rama Mannar, were against this decision. 
			 Raja Mannar temporarily delegated his responsibilities to Radha Rama and left Khansaar to look over a concerning issue.
			 In order to prevent violence in his absence, Radha Rama proposed imposing a ceasefire, but her decision was opposed to a large extent and a voting on whether to lift the ceasefire or impose it was supposed to be scheduled after nine days. 
			 Immediately, all the Doras and Kapus brought powerful mercenary armies from Serbia, Austria, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Russia and South Sudan with the intent of usurping the throne as soon as the voting ended. Vardha, meanwhile, turned to Deva, who resided in Bharucha, Gujarat with his mother. 
			 Deva re-entered Khansaar and for most of the days, tolerated the humiliation of Vardha. However, he eventually fought and murdered Vishnu, son of Narang, one of the Doras, as he tried to force a young girl into prostitution; instigated by Bhaarava, Rudra pit Narang against Vardha and directed him to punish Vardha during the trial, instead of Deva. 
			 During the trial, an infuriated Deva slaughtered and beheaded Narang for manhandling Vardha, after pleading with him not to do so, stunning all the witnesses. Vardha, Deva and all of their associates including Vardha's younger brother Baachi, aides Bilal and Rinda, and advisor Gaikwad alias Baba were all apprehended.
			 On the day of the voting, Raja Mannar suddenly returned to Khansaar and voted to continue the ceasefire, in favor of Vardha. However, Vardha, with his deciding vote, voted to terminate the imposition of the ceasefire. Immediately, everyone staked their claim for the throne; Vardha, after defeating drug-addicted men dispatched by Ranga with Deva's assistance, broke out of prison and assassinated Ranga. 
			 Raja Mannar disclosed to Radha Rama that Bhaarava hailed from the Shouryaanga tribe and is one of the few people that survived the massacre. Elsewhere, Bhaarava and an army of the surviving Shouryaanga tribesmen swore vengeance against Raja Mannar for the genocide of their tribe. Rudra joined hands with his maternal uncle, Om, for the throne. Bhaarava's captured associate, Dheru, revealed to Raja Mannar and Radha Rama that Deva is actually Devaratha Raisaar, the son of Dhaara Raisaar, who headed the Shouryaanga tribe and was supposed to be the next king of Khansaar. 
			 Simultaneously, Vardha addressed Deva as his Salaar, just as his loyalists came to know that he is a Shouryaanga tribesman.</p>
